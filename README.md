# AI Racing Project

## Abstract
Given a simulation of racing tracks and agents controlling realistic cars on the track, this project
aims to train some agents to finish them in the least amount of time. Different models are to be used
to control the agents based on inputs from the simulation. After training on the same simulation, the
performance of the models will be compared in terms of lap times.
